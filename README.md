<p align="center"><img src="/path/to/your/logo/image.png" width="400" alt="Sign Language Recognition Logo"></p>

## Overview

The **Sign Language Recognition System** is a Python-based application that aims to detect and recognize various sign language gestures using computer vision techniques. It leverages a live webcam feed to classify hand gestures in real-time, aiding in communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments.

This project is built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Machine Learning** libraries to process hand signs and recognize them using a trained model.

## Features

- **Real-time sign language detection** through a live webcam.
- **High accuracy** using trained machine learning models.
- **Interactive UI** for easy use and demonstration.
- **Supports multiple sign languages** (expandable).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **OpenCV**: For capturing video feed and image processing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For model building and training.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualization of results.
- **Flask** (optional): For deploying the application on a web platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your local machine.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for running the development environment.
- **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and other dependencies installed using `pip`.

### Installing Dependencies

To install the required Python packages, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python tensorflow matplotlib flask
```

```

## How to Run

### Jupyter Notebook

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-recognition.git
   cd sign-language-recognition
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open the detection notebook** (`notebooks/SignLanguageRecognition.ipynb`) and run all cells to start detection.

### Running with Flask (Optional)

If you want to run the system as a web application:

1. **Run the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open the web browser** and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. **Start detection** by clicking the "Run Detection" button.

## Usage

### For Real-Time Detection:

- Open the notebook or Flask application.
- Allow webcam access for live feed processing.
- The system will display the recognized sign language gesture with the corresponding confidence level.

### Model Training (Optional):

- If you want to retrain the model or add more signs, you can modify the training notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.
- Update the `models/` folder with the newly trained models.

## Future Enhancements

- Expanding the sign language dataset for improved accuracy.
- Supporting additional sign languages.
- Integrating deep learning models for better performance.
- Implementing feedback for wrong predictions.
